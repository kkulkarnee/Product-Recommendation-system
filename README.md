# Product-Recommendation-system


E-commerce websites use recommendations as a targeted marketing tool in both email campaigns and on most of the pages of its website. They will recommend many products from different categories based on what you are browsing and pull those products in front of you which you are likely to buy. Like the ‘frequently bought together’ option that comes at the bottom of the product page to lure you into buying the combo. This recommendation has one main goal: increase average order value i.e., to up-sell and cross-sell customers by providing product suggestions based on the items in their shopping cart or below products they’re currently looking at on-site. They use the browsing history of a user to always keep those products in the eye of the customer. It uses the ratings and reviews of customers to display the products with a greater average in the recommended and best selling option. E-commerce websites want to make us buy a package rather than one product. Say you bought a phone, it will then recommend you to buy a case or a screen protector. It will further use the recommendations from the engine to email and keep you engaged with the current trend of the product/category.
